## SUMMARY:
Please make sure you have completed the soot survey at:
    [soot.binghamton.edu](https://soot.binghamton.edu)

Please list the urls for the APIs you used:
Star Wars: https://www.swapi.tech/
Yes/No: https://yesno.wtf/api

Summary of Program: This program simulates a fight between two star wars characters. It asks the user to input two numbers between 1 and 83 which decides the two characters. The Yes or No API is then used to decide how the fight will be won-either based on height or weight.

Most Challenging topic in the course: Pygame- the syntax of pygame is very different from all of the stuff we learn up to that point, so it took me a lot of time to figure out the new syntax.
